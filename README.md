# Udacity Nanodegree Project 3 Arcade Game Clone by Cameron Gillespie

The part of the app that I was required to write consists of 3 functional pieces
1. The player 
- Render the player at required starting position.
- Enable the player to move by accepting certain keystrokes and moving the player in different directions, but adding or subtracting from player's x,y properties.
- Also prevent player from leaving play area.
2. The Enemies 
- Move the enemies across game area in one of three different rows. 
- Enemies' speed and row is randomized on game start and when enemy reaches the end of a row.
3. Collision Detection
- Reset the player's position to the start if enemy any player are within a certain distance to eachother, which is 10 pixels in the case of my implementation.
